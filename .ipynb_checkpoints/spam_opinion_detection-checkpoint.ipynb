I did that and tried them before I walked out with them. After getting them home and trying them out on a tripod for about 2 hours in daylight, I have to say that the quality of the optics is amazing for this price. Center sharpness is just phenomenal and doesn't really degrade much until you look towards the edges. But if you demand edge-to-edge sharpness then you need to start spending the bucks to get it. For most of the field of view these are more than sharp enough.One small negative - the included tripod mount is way too wobbly. I reinforced it by bolting two thin metal plates to it and that helped a great deal. Someone else mentioned that they filled it with epoxy (it's an i-beam type of construction). That seems like a good idea also.But for this kind of money, this is an insanely good pair of binoculars.</th>\n",

While processor speeds, memory and buses have all scaled up to be able to support higher transfer rates, the lowly HDD has only modestly improved by comparison. So, in this day and age of multi-gigabyte application and OS installations, it starts to become very apparent that in order to achieve the kind of lightning fast performance we all dreamed of 20 years ago, the HDD has to go.Enter the Crucial M4 SSD... one of the least expensive, yet best performing of the current generation SATA3/6Gbps drives. To be fair, it's not the fastest drive on the market. But it does have a very stable controller and the firmware is fairly mature. I chose this particular SSD after doing exhaustive comparisons with its contemporaries and found it to be the best balance of price, performance and stability of the bunch. Installation on my early-2011 MacBook Pro was a breeze, with no surprises.Out of the box, my M4 was already flashed with the latest firmware version. Within 2 months of owning it, Crucial released yet another update. It flashed just fine, without having any data loss (which as I understand it, can be problematic with some other models). After that, a quick Google search yielded an effective procedure to enable TRIM support in OS X. Aside from those steps, installation of my OS and apps was unremarkable - roughly akin to installing a new hard drive, but MUCH faster. With my old HDD installed in a Firewire 800 enclosure, cloning it back to the SSD was a relatively simple affair.The difference in performance is readily apparent upon first boot - that is to say, the OS now boots within 15 seconds - and that counts the EFI firmware initialization process (which is roughly 1/3 of the wait time). And once it booted, I became spoiled by instant starting of all of my apps. I no longer wait for anything - and this is the first time since switching over to the Mac that I haven't missed having an HDD activity light. I no longer need to wonder about whether there's drive activity since every I/O process is pretty much instant.The only downside? I have to use a Windows machine at work all day long with traditional storage - and now I've found that I'm extremely impatient.So, in short, if you have the money and you value your time, an SSD is the only way to go. Just beware that you may spoil yourself and find that you want to upgrade all of the other computers you come into contact with!</th>\n",

The theory behind this is that you won't get a ticket if you know a copper is in the area, hence people will slow down and put away their crack pipes. It can also pick up strange alien frequencies, Pavarotti concerts, AM/FM radio signals and certain Republican conventions, which are a complete bore.</th>\n",

When I saw this headrest device I thought this had to be the perfect solution for a quiet, well behaved journey. It really was a breeze to install; in fact it simply just slipped right in to the headrest very easily. I was pleased with the long cable that came with it as this was six feet or more long I found we did not need all of the cable length, so I was chuffed to see it had a neat little hidden pouch to tuck any excess away and out of sight. In fact all trailing wires and cables are completely hidden out of view so it actually looks to the stranger looking into your car like you have an in-car DVD entertainment system. Of course in reality all we actually have is a headrest mount holder with a charger and a cable. This device is tailored specifically for the iPad so everything fitted neatly into pla ce when we placed it on the back of the front passenger seat headrest. When we get our next iPad I will certainly considering getting another one for the driver's seat.</th>\n",

I was not sure how comfortable it may be after several uses. So I ended up buying one to be used primarily with my laptop during travel.It is so intelligently designed that it turns itself off when it's in its flat position. This keeps the battery from draining when not in use. It feels comfortable in my hand. I'm writing this review after using this mouse for almost 6 months now. It's always comfortable though after several hours of continuous use, your hand may get more tired than if you were using a truly ergonomic mouse. However, as I mentioned, I use it primarily when I am traveling and it's still far superior to some of the compact laptop mice that I used.Another great thing about this is the \"cool\" factor. People who have never seen this mouse before often ask me about it. I'm glad that the mouse is not white in color otherwise it could be easily assumed that it's an Apple product. Some people still get surprised to see the Microsoft logo on it. But I bought it neither for the cool factor nor the Microsoft logo. I bought it for its intelligent design and totally love it.</th>\n",

       "      <th>For many years, the largest bottleneck in computers has been their mass storage. While processor speeds, memory and buses have all scaled up to be able to support higher transfer rates, the lowly HDD has only modestly improved by comparison. So, in this day and age of multi-gigabyte application and OS installations, it starts to become very apparent that in order to achieve the kind of lightning fast performance we all dreamed of 20 years ago, the HDD has to go.Enter the Crucial M4 SSD... one of the least expensive, yet best performing of the current generation SATA3/6Gbps drives. To be fair, it's not the fastest drive on the market. But it does have a very stable controller and the firmware is fairly mature. I chose this particular SSD after doing exhaustive comparisons with its contemporaries and found it to be the best balance of price, performance and stability of the bunch. Installation on my early-2011 MacBook Pro was a breeze, with no surprises.Out of the box, my M4 was already flashed with the latest firmware version. Within 2 months of owning it, Crucial released yet another update. It flashed just fine, without having any data loss (which as I understand it, can be problematic with some other models). After that, a quick Google search yielded an effective procedure to enable TRIM support in OS X. Aside from those steps, installation of my OS and apps was unremarkable - roughly akin to installing a new hard drive, but MUCH faster. With my old HDD installed in a Firewire 800 enclosure, cloning it back to the SSD was a relatively simple affair.The difference in performance is readily apparent upon first boot - that is to say, the OS now boots within 15 seconds - and that counts the EFI firmware initialization process (which is roughly 1/3 of the wait time). And once it booted, I became spoiled by instant starting of all of my apps. I no longer wait for anything - and this is the first time since switching over to the Mac that I haven't missed having an HDD activity light. I no longer need to wonder about whether there's drive activity since every I/O process is pretty much instant.The only downside? I have to use a Windows machine at work all day long with traditional storage - and now I've found that I'm extremely impatient.So, in short, if you have the money and you value your time, an SSD is the only way to go. Just beware that you may spoil yourself and find that you want to upgrade all of the other computers you come into contact with!</th>\n",

       "      <th>Hi,so this is an awesome Mainboard and I have nothing to add to the many overclockers and benchmarkers out there that used this board for latest experiments and reaching high scores in the shortest times with the least overclock knowledge needed. It is very self regulating and working fine to prevents itself from damage ;) The BIOS is awesome and usable with mouse and the intel iGPU can be combined with the nvidia GPU, which is normally not possible. (Intel supports their intel graphics, and nvidia their nvidia - unlike AMD and ATI)However - dangerous part comes here:When switching to this mainboard from cheap ASROCK before, I didnt save my windows or made backups to use it later on. After booting I got bluescreens on WinXP SP3 and Win7 ultimate. While trying to boot in repair mode on win7 and hitting on \"command mode\" a noisy shortcut rang my ears and the PC went off. For my luck nothing happend, but I guess the use of old windows and therefor wrong drivers is not always a safe thing to use. Normally it should not boot those and ask for new drivers. That is how I knew it all those years. I guess the many security features of my power supply or the mainboard saved me from killing the mainboard with this shortcut.This is the first mainboard for me that forced me to install a whole new windows - so be prepared to have your files \"import ready\". It is not all compatible by changing boards which can even damage your hardware.Summary: The most impressive mainboard I ever had - too bad there is no support to old connectors as RS232, IDE, PCIThe onboard sound is delicious clear and I replaced an older 24 bit creative audigy zs platinum with it.</th>\n",

I would guess that the drives I've cloned would be capable of higher speeds then this duplicator was able to achieve. Still, I wouldn't call it slow, just not as fast as I had hoped. (If you want slow, duplicate a pair of 2 TB USB drives.)The nice thing is that it truly is a stand alone, plug in, run, and forget device. You don't have to tie up a computer for hours to duplicate the drives. The progress bar is accurate and it seems to be very reliable.If you frequently need to duplicate drives then I recommend it.I struggled between 4 and 5 stars because I would really have liked to see StarTech squeeze more performance out of this. But in the end I'm giving it 5 because it's simple and just works. I needed that in drive duplication.</th>\n",

       "      <th>I've been an serious amateur (if that isn't an oxymornon) photographer since 1955. Four years ago, I went digital with an Olympus 3.2 megapixel Camedia. Love that camera, but started having problems (over-exposure in all modes, and contrast off especially in macro. After six months of study, I decided on the A620, and am moderately happy with my decision.I should explain that, no matter how much investigating you do, you'll never know if you made the right decision. When I bought the Olympus, the choices were limited to perhaps four 3+ megapixel cameras. Now, with a hundred choices, your chances of getting the ideal camera are slim IF you know digital cameras at all. Sometimes, ignorance is bliss.A620 pros: Easy to use. Menus are well laid out, though the primary button on the back of the camera could have \"easier\" more readable buttons. But once you get used to them, they're fine. Love the various special effects that you can add to your pictures. And even the movie mode will give a decent movie if you have a 1 gig card.The LCD is fantastic, and revolved 180 degrees. Not that I expected to take a self-portrait, but I actually have used the easy-to-see (in most any light) LCD for all kinds of shots.The viewfinder (a must for those of you who are looking at any digital camera) is good, and off by only a degree or two.Pictures are sharp and the lens is as good as Olympus Zuiko, and that's going some.Before I forget, I'd give Canon an A+ on its software. It is downright simple and though I might have to use Thumbs+ or Photoshop for minor tweaking, this software is a snap on layouts and printing. Many who have written about Canon's software call it \"weak\" or \"for beginners only.\" Well, I'm no beginner, and it's a pleasure to get a composite print or contact sheet set up and printed in 5 minutes.Portraits and landscapes are excellent. Closeups...see below.It's fast.It has the feel of a 35mm camera. It has some weight and it's comfortable.The zoom is very good.Cons: Can't turn off flash in Auto mode.The macro is trickier than the Olympus and doesn't always produce good results. One trick is that you press the shutter button half-way before taking the picture, and you'll get better focus. Half of my pictures are macros, and I've been somewhat disappointed. I think that going to the manual mode is the solution, and that may put off most who go the digital route for more than just point and shoot.The warning light for using a tripod seemingly comes on 80% of the time. Admittedly, we've had rain in California since I bought the camera, but I have no trouble keeping the camera steady and, in low light suituations, letting the flash do the rest.I'd recommend the camera, but if you're looking for one that you can just tuck in your shirt pocket, this isn't for you.</th>\n",

       "      <th>Most of laptop cooler/chill pads are made of PLASTIC and use fans that blow air TOWARDS the laptop. What impresses me about this product is that the cooling surface is made of ALUMINUM (just like the aluminum casing used to keep portable hard drives cool) and its fans PULL/SUCK HOT AIR AWAY from underneath the laptop. This method of REMOVING hot air is superior to blowing room temperature air at the laptop (it's also the same mechanism used by laptop/desktop internal fans).MY TESTS: I compared the latest Targus high-speed chill mat (Model PA248U) to this one. After running the laptop for one hour on each, I noticed the surface of the laptop (keyboard, palm rest, touch pad, etc.) was the same in both cases (very cool). But there was a noticeable difference on left side of my laptop (where my Dell's internal fan exhausts warm air). With the Targus, there was noticeable amounts of warm air being exhausted by the laptop's internal fan. With the Antec, there was much less warm air being exhausted than the Targus. So the Antec does a superior job cooling the laptop since the laptop's internal fan was exhausting less hot air.MINOR DETAILS: The Antec allows you to control the speed of the fan (high or low) while the Targus is fixed, presumably at high (and is rather noisy). The Targus does have a simple push on/off switch; the Antec does not (you have to unplug it for off). The Antec's USB cord is pass-through meaning Antec will NOT take us one USB slot (the Targus did not have this feature). The Antec has a very strong Blue LED light to indicate it is on (it could be helpful as an on/off indicator, but it is very annoying in low-light condition because it is very bright).BOTTOM LINE: Because the cooling surface is made of aluminum and because the fans work to draw hot air away from the laptop (much like your laptop's internal fan), Antec is a superior product. Also, my simple tests showed that the laptop was cooler using Antec.</th>\n",

       "      <th>The iPod Touch 5th generation has come a long way since the launch of the first generation iPod a few years go. There are several features that I love about this new Touch. My quick impressions so far after having used it for just under a week.FORM FACTOR - The Touch is thinner than iPhone 5 though still has the same 4-inch retina display. The overall experience is significantly better using this device compared to the Touch 4. I was pretty happy with my Touch 4, but now looking at it after playing with the Touch 5, it just seems small! The 5 is thinner and lighter than even the iPhone 5. Very slick.BODY - The back is anodized aluminum finish in amazing colors. The matte finish makes it less scratch-prone (at least so far it seems that way) compared to the steel-backed Touch 4. The body is slightly more rectangular and less curved than the 4, making it easier to use the side volume buttons. I honestly don't think a case is necessary for this device given its beautiful colors and fairly scratch-resistant body, but that again would be entirely a personal decision. Some folks are prone to dropping devices in which case a case is a must. My 2 cents - a transparent case would probably be best which at least allows the beauty of the device to come through. Putting on a thick black case on this would be doing it severe injustice!CAMERA - The camera is in my opinion one of the best features of the Touch. The Touch has a 5MP camera, which I think is the same as the iPhone though I could be wrong on this. It gives 1080p recording in this slick device, makes me think back of the loaded camcorders we carried and converted tapes to DVDs, and that wasn't so long ago! The camera, same as the iPhone camera, gives the panoramic option which lets you capture a pretty wide angle shot. I tried this feature only in the house, but due to different lighting in the different areas that I was shooting, the picture didn't come out so well. I'm sure if taken with correct lighting or outdoors, the panoramic pictures would be spectacular. I wonder if the camera is meant to be the main feature of the Touch that Apple wants to push, given that they included a hand strap with the touch, just like most cameras come with.A5 PROCESSOR - The difference in speed because of the A5 processor is quite noticeable, for the better. It makes the device much faster - for apps, loading videos, etc. For the few apps that I use often, the speed is remarkable.EARBUDS - I don't use the Apple earphones because they have been uncomfortable for me personally. I tried the new earbuds and these fit much better. Sound quality maybe just about the same, at least I didn't notice any significant difference. I'm happy using my Bose or Sony headphones with the Touch. The speaker on the iPod is decent for light listening or watching videos. It's really not meant to give surround sound, but the speakers do their job fine.CONNECTOR - The lightning connector is probably better for charging speeds and data transfer (I guess), but the only good thing that I find about this is that the cable can be inserted either way into the Touch. Unlike the previous 30-pin connector that could only be inserted one way up. One thing to note - and this might have just been me but I did see some reviews earlier to this effect - the USB end of the adapter is probably the same as all USBs. But, for some reason, when I plugged it in to my car charger, it got stuck in it. I struggled for a good 5 minutes to get it out. I had no problems with my 30-pin connector cable with this charger. I later read reviews for the car charger and other folks had mentioned the same thing. Not sure what the issue was, maybe just a few isolated events. But for now I am not using any non-Apple approved charger, even if it is just a USB charger. Another problem I have faced is that when I connect the iPod to the USB jack in my car, there are times when the sound comes through the iPod instead of the car speakers. The iPod is connected and shows \"Accessory Connected\". I then have to unlplug the device and plug it back in, and then it works fine. This has happened 2-3 times over the past few days. I'm not sure if this has to do with the lightning cable or the car's USB port.SOFTWARE - It runs on iOS6 and the speed is amazing. Note that it doesn't have Google Maps which I sorely miss, but that's an issue more with iOS6 rather than the ouch itself. Hopefully Apple's maps will get better :) It has built-in Siri but I don't use Siri myself so can't comment on that.It's hard to compare this with the iPhone because this is not a phone, though you can download Skype or Vonage Mobile and use these apps to turn the Touch into a makeshift phone. I guess it could be compared to other tablets which do pretty much the same thing as the Touch for the most part. A lot of the tablets are cheaper in price, though have less storage capacity and can't be used so efficiently as a camera, or an MP3 player while working out.All in all I am very impressed and pleased with the Touch 5 so far. Whether to buy or upgrade to this device is entirely a personal decision depending on what you're looking for.</th>\n",

       "      <th>For many years, the largest bottleneck in computers has been their mass storage. While processor speeds, memory and buses have all scaled up to be able to support higher transfer rates, the lowly HDD has only modestly improved by comparison. So, in this day and age of multi-gigabyte application and OS installations, it starts to become very apparent that in order to achieve the kind of lightning fast performance we all dreamed of 20 years ago, the HDD has to go.Enter the Crucial M4 SSD... one of the least expensive, yet best performing of the current generation SATA3/6Gbps drives. To be fair, it's not the fastest drive on the market. But it does have a very stable controller and the firmware is fairly mature. I chose this particular SSD after doing exhaustive comparisons with its contemporaries and found it to be the best balance of price, performance and stability of the bunch. Installation on my early-2011 MacBook Pro was a breeze, with no surprises.Out of the box, my M4 was already flashed with the latest firmware version. Within 2 months of owning it, Crucial released yet another update. It flashed just fine, without having any data loss (which as I understand it, can be problematic with some other models). After that, a quick Google search yielded an effective procedure to enable TRIM support in OS X. Aside from those steps, installation of my OS and apps was unremarkable - roughly akin to installing a new hard drive, but MUCH faster. With my old HDD installed in a Firewire 800 enclosure, cloning it back to the SSD was a relatively simple affair.The difference in performance is readily apparent upon first boot - that is to say, the OS now boots within 15 seconds - and that counts the EFI firmware initialization process (which is roughly 1/3 of the wait time). And once it booted, I became spoiled by instant starting of all of my apps. I no longer wait for anything - and this is the first time since switching over to the Mac that I haven't missed having an HDD activity light. I no longer need to wonder about whether there's drive activity since every I/O process is pretty much instant.The only downside? I have to use a Windows machine at work all day long with traditional storage - and now I've found that I'm extremely impatient.So, in short, if you have the money and you value your time, an SSD is the only way to go. Just beware that you may spoil yourself and find that you want to upgrade all of the other computers you come into contact with!</th>\n",

       "      <th>For many years, the largest bottleneck in computers has been their mass storage. While processor speeds, memory and buses have all scaled up to be able to support higher transfer rates, the lowly HDD has only modestly improved by comparison. So, in this day and age of multi-gigabyte application and OS installations, it starts to become very apparent that in order to achieve the kind of lightning fast performance we all dreamed of 20 years ago, the HDD has to go.Enter the Crucial M4 SSD... one of the least expensive, yet best performing of the current generation SATA3/6Gbps drives. To be fair, it's not the fastest drive on the market. But it does have a very stable controller and the firmware is fairly mature. I chose this particular SSD after doing exhaustive comparisons with its contemporaries and found it to be the best balance of price, performance and stability of the bunch. Installation on my early-2011 MacBook Pro was a breeze, with no surprises.Out of the box, my M4 was already flashed with the latest firmware version. Within 2 months of owning it, Crucial released yet another update. It flashed just fine, without having any data loss (which as I understand it, can be problematic with some other models). After that, a quick Google search yielded an effective procedure to enable TRIM support in OS X. Aside from those steps, installation of my OS and apps was unremarkable - roughly akin to installing a new hard drive, but MUCH faster. With my old HDD installed in a Firewire 800 enclosure, cloning it back to the SSD was a relatively simple affair.The difference in performance is readily apparent upon first boot - that is to say, the OS now boots within 15 seconds - and that counts the EFI firmware initialization process (which is roughly 1/3 of the wait time). And once it booted, I became spoiled by instant starting of all of my apps. I no longer wait for anything - and this is the first time since switching over to the Mac that I haven't missed having an HDD activity light. I no longer need to wonder about whether there's drive activity since every I/O process is pretty much instant.The only downside? I have to use a Windows machine at work all day long with traditional storage - and now I've found that I'm extremely impatient.So, in short, if you have the money and you value your time, an SSD is the only way to go. Just beware that you may spoil yourself and find that you want to upgrade all of the other computers you come into contact with!</th>\n",

       "      <th>Hi,so this is an awesome Mainboard and I have nothing to add to the many overclockers and benchmarkers out there that used this board for latest experiments and reaching high scores in the shortest times with the least overclock knowledge needed. It is very self regulating and working fine to prevents itself from damage ;) The BIOS is awesome and usable with mouse and the intel iGPU can be combined with the nvidia GPU, which is normally not possible. (Intel supports their intel graphics, and nvidia their nvidia - unlike AMD and ATI)However - dangerous part comes here:When switching to this mainboard from cheap ASROCK before, I didnt save my windows or made backups to use it later on. After booting I got bluescreens on WinXP SP3 and Win7 ultimate. While trying to boot in repair mode on win7 and hitting on \"command mode\" a noisy shortcut rang my ears and the PC went off. For my luck nothing happend, but I guess the use of old windows and therefor wrong drivers is not always a safe thing to use. Normally it should not boot those and ask for new drivers. That is how I knew it all those years. I guess the many security features of my power supply or the mainboard saved me from killing the mainboard with this shortcut.This is the first mainboard for me that forced me to install a whole new windows - so be prepared to have your files \"import ready\". It is not all compatible by changing boards which can even damage your hardware.Summary: The most impressive mainboard I ever had - too bad there is no support to old connectors as RS232, IDE, PCIThe onboard sound is delicious clear and I replaced an older 24 bit creative audigy zs platinum with it.</th>\n",

I would guess that the drives I've cloned would be capable of higher speeds then this duplicator was able to achieve. Still, I wouldn't call it slow, just not as fast as I had hoped. (If you want slow, duplicate a pair of 2 TB USB drives.)The nice thing is that it truly is a stand alone, plug in, run, and forget device. You don't have to tie up a computer for hours to duplicate the drives. The progress bar is accurate and it seems to be very reliable.If you frequently need to duplicate drives then I recommend it.I struggled between 4 and 5 stars because I would really have liked to see StarTech squeeze more performance out of this. But in the end I'm giving it 5 because it's simple and just works. I needed that in drive duplication.</th>\n",

       "      <th>I've been an serious amateur (if that isn't an oxymornon) photographer since 1955. Four years ago, I went digital with an Olympus 3.2 megapixel Camedia. Love that camera, but started having problems (over-exposure in all modes, and contrast off especially in macro. After six months of study, I decided on the A620, and am moderately happy with my decision.I should explain that, no matter how much investigating you do, you'll never know if you made the right decision. When I bought the Olympus, the choices were limited to perhaps four 3+ megapixel cameras. Now, with a hundred choices, your chances of getting the ideal camera are slim IF you know digital cameras at all. Sometimes, ignorance is bliss.A620 pros: Easy to use. Menus are well laid out, though the primary button on the back of the camera could have \"easier\" more readable buttons. But once you get used to them, they're fine. Love the various special effects that you can add to your pictures. And even the movie mode will give a decent movie if you have a 1 gig card.The LCD is fantastic, and revolved 180 degrees. Not that I expected to take a self-portrait, but I actually have used the easy-to-see (in most any light) LCD for all kinds of shots.The viewfinder (a must for those of you who are looking at any digital camera) is good, and off by only a degree or two.Pictures are sharp and the lens is as good as Olympus Zuiko, and that's going some.Before I forget, I'd give Canon an A+ on its software. It is downright simple and though I might have to use Thumbs+ or Photoshop for minor tweaking, this software is a snap on layouts and printing. Many who have written about Canon's software call it \"weak\" or \"for beginners only.\" Well, I'm no beginner, and it's a pleasure to get a composite print or contact sheet set up and printed in 5 minutes.Portraits and landscapes are excellent. Closeups...see below.It's fast.It has the feel of a 35mm camera. It has some weight and it's comfortable.The zoom is very good.Cons: Can't turn off flash in Auto mode.The macro is trickier than the Olympus and doesn't always produce good results. One trick is that you press the shutter button half-way before taking the picture, and you'll get better focus. Half of my pictures are macros, and I've been somewhat disappointed. I think that going to the manual mode is the solution, and that may put off most who go the digital route for more than just point and shoot.The warning light for using a tripod seemingly comes on 80% of the time. Admittedly, we've had rain in California since I bought the camera, but I have no trouble keeping the camera steady and, in low light suituations, letting the flash do the rest.I'd recommend the camera, but if you're looking for one that you can just tuck in your shirt pocket, this isn't for you.</th>\n",

       "      <th>Most of laptop cooler/chill pads are made of PLASTIC and use fans that blow air TOWARDS the laptop. What impresses me about this product is that the cooling surface is made of ALUMINUM (just like the aluminum casing used to keep portable hard drives cool) and its fans PULL/SUCK HOT AIR AWAY from underneath the laptop. This method of REMOVING hot air is superior to blowing room temperature air at the laptop (it's also the same mechanism used by laptop/desktop internal fans).MY TESTS: I compared the latest Targus high-speed chill mat (Model PA248U) to this one. After running the laptop for one hour on each, I noticed the surface of the laptop (keyboard, palm rest, touch pad, etc.) was the same in both cases (very cool). But there was a noticeable difference on left side of my laptop (where my Dell's internal fan exhausts warm air). With the Targus, there was noticeable amounts of warm air being exhausted by the laptop's internal fan. With the Antec, there was much less warm air being exhausted than the Targus. So the Antec does a superior job cooling the laptop since the laptop's internal fan was exhausting less hot air.MINOR DETAILS: The Antec allows you to control the speed of the fan (high or low) while the Targus is fixed, presumably at high (and is rather noisy). The Targus does have a simple push on/off switch; the Antec does not (you have to unplug it for off). The Antec's USB cord is pass-through meaning Antec will NOT take us one USB slot (the Targus did not have this feature). The Antec has a very strong Blue LED light to indicate it is on (it could be helpful as an on/off indicator, but it is very annoying in low-light condition because it is very bright).BOTTOM LINE: Because the cooling surface is made of aluminum and because the fans work to draw hot air away from the laptop (much like your laptop's internal fan), Antec is a superior product. Also, my simple tests showed that the laptop was cooler using Antec.</th>\n",

       "      <th>The iPod Touch 5th generation has come a long way since the launch of the first generation iPod a few years go. There are several features that I love about this new Touch. My quick impressions so far after having used it for just under a week.FORM FACTOR - The Touch is thinner than iPhone 5 though still has the same 4-inch retina display. The overall experience is significantly better using this device compared to the Touch 4. I was pretty happy with my Touch 4, but now looking at it after playing with the Touch 5, it just seems small! The 5 is thinner and lighter than even the iPhone 5. Very slick.BODY - The back is anodized aluminum finish in amazing colors. The matte finish makes it less scratch-prone (at least so far it seems that way) compared to the steel-backed Touch 4. The body is slightly more rectangular and less curved than the 4, making it easier to use the side volume buttons. I honestly don't think a case is necessary for this device given its beautiful colors and fairly scratch-resistant body, but that again would be entirely a personal decision. Some folks are prone to dropping devices in which case a case is a must. My 2 cents - a transparent case would probably be best which at least allows the beauty of the device to come through. Putting on a thick black case on this would be doing it severe injustice!CAMERA - The camera is in my opinion one of the best features of the Touch. The Touch has a 5MP camera, which I think is the same as the iPhone though I could be wrong on this. It gives 1080p recording in this slick device, makes me think back of the loaded camcorders we carried and converted tapes to DVDs, and that wasn't so long ago! The camera, same as the iPhone camera, gives the panoramic option which lets you capture a pretty wide angle shot. I tried this feature only in the house, but due to different lighting in the different areas that I was shooting, the picture didn't come out so well. I'm sure if taken with correct lighting or outdoors, the panoramic pictures would be spectacular. I wonder if the camera is meant to be the main feature of the Touch that Apple wants to push, given that they included a hand strap with the touch, just like most cameras come with.A5 PROCESSOR - The difference in speed because of the A5 processor is quite noticeable, for the better. It makes the device much faster - for apps, loading videos, etc. For the few apps that I use often, the speed is remarkable.EARBUDS - I don't use the Apple earphones because they have been uncomfortable for me personally. I tried the new earbuds and these fit much better. Sound quality maybe just about the same, at least I didn't notice any significant difference. I'm happy using my Bose or Sony headphones with the Touch. The speaker on the iPod is decent for light listening or watching videos. It's really not meant to give surround sound, but the speakers do their job fine.CONNECTOR - The lightning connector is probably better for charging speeds and data transfer (I guess), but the only good thing that I find about this is that the cable can be inserted either way into the Touch. Unlike the previous 30-pin connector that could only be inserted one way up. One thing to note - and this might have just been me but I did see some reviews earlier to this effect - the USB end of the adapter is probably the same as all USBs. But, for some reason, when I plugged it in to my car charger, it got stuck in it. I struggled for a good 5 minutes to get it out. I had no problems with my 30-pin connector cable with this charger. I later read reviews for the car charger and other folks had mentioned the same thing. Not sure what the issue was, maybe just a few isolated events. But for now I am not using any non-Apple approved charger, even if it is just a USB charger. Another problem I have faced is that when I connect the iPod to the USB jack in my car, there are times when the sound comes through the iPod instead of the car speakers. The iPod is connected and shows \"Accessory Connected\". I then have to unlplug the device and plug it back in, and then it works fine. This has happened 2-3 times over the past few days. I'm not sure if this has to do with the lightning cable or the car's USB port.SOFTWARE - It runs on iOS6 and the speed is amazing. Note that it doesn't have Google Maps which I sorely miss, but that's an issue more with iOS6 rather than the ouch itself. Hopefully Apple's maps will get better :) It has built-in Siri but I don't use Siri myself so can't comment on that.It's hard to compare this with the iPhone because this is not a phone, though you can download Skype or Vonage Mobile and use these apps to turn the Touch into a makeshift phone. I guess it could be compared to other tablets which do pretty much the same thing as the Touch for the most part. A lot of the tablets are cheaper in price, though have less storage capacity and can't be used so efficiently as a camera, or an MP3 player while working out.All in all I am very impressed and pleased with the Touch 5 so far. Whether to buy or upgrade to this device is entirely a personal decision depending on what you're looking for.</th>\n",

       "      <th>For many years, the largest bottleneck in computers has been their mass storage. While processor speeds, memory and buses have all scaled up to be able to support higher transfer rates, the lowly HDD has only modestly improved by comparison. So, in this day and age of multi-gigabyte application and OS installations, it starts to become very apparent that in order to achieve the kind of lightning fast performance we all dreamed of 20 years ago, the HDD has to go.Enter the Crucial M4 SSD... one of the least expensive, yet best performing of the current generation SATA3/6Gbps drives. To be fair, it's not the fastest drive on the market. But it does have a very stable controller and the firmware is fairly mature. I chose this particular SSD after doing exhaustive comparisons with its contemporaries and found it to be the best balance of price, performance and stability of the bunch. Installation on my early-2011 MacBook Pro was a breeze, with no surprises.Out of the box, my M4 was already flashed with the latest firmware version. Within 2 months of owning it, Crucial released yet another update. It flashed just fine, without having any data loss (which as I understand it, can be problematic with some other models). After that, a quick Google search yielded an effective procedure to enable TRIM support in OS X. Aside from those steps, installation of my OS and apps was unremarkable - roughly akin to installing a new hard drive, but MUCH faster. With my old HDD installed in a Firewire 800 enclosure, cloning it back to the SSD was a relatively simple affair.The difference in performance is readily apparent upon first boot - that is to say, the OS now boots within 15 seconds - and that counts the EFI firmware initialization process (which is roughly 1/3 of the wait time). And once it booted, I became spoiled by instant starting of all of my apps. I no longer wait for anything - and this is the first time since switching over to the Mac that I haven't missed having an HDD activity light. I no longer need to wonder about whether there's drive activity since every I/O process is pretty much instant.The only downside? I have to use a Windows machine at work all day long with traditional storage - and now I've found that I'm extremely impatient.So, in short, if you have the money and you value your time, an SSD is the only way to go. Just beware that you may spoil yourself and find that you want to upgrade all of the other computers you come into contact with!</th>\n",
